# TheCyrclePhone2G
The Cyrcle Phone 2G was an very early prototype for The Cyrcle Phone 4G, using Seeed Studio's RePhone Kit Create modules and a 3D printed enclosure designed by Christina Cyr. It was meant simply to obtain feedback on the concept, and not originally intended for sale. Unexpectedly, during user studies, many people asked to buy it. So, after checking first with Seeed Studio, it was sold locally and via a successful Kickstarter campaign. All units were delivered with in-person classes within 60 days, 5 months earlier than promised. Much was learned.
In this repo you will find links to Seeed Studio's hardware and software resources for the RePhone Kit Create modules, and the CAD files designed by Christina Cyr.
